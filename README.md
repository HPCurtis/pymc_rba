# PyMC RBA
Direct PyMC implementation of AFNIs' region Based analysis (RBA) analysis.

The follwing repo is inspired by work that I was privy too at OHBM hackathon that was inspired by the the AFNI group reasearcher Gang chen who implemeted Bayesian multilevel modelling for region based analysis with the use Brms BÃ¼rkner (2021) and the [RBA.R programme](https://github.com/afni/afni/blob/master/src/R_scripts/RBA.R) who initially wanted to implement the programme through PyBrms [see](https://github.com/adamhaber/pybrms). Unforutnately their is no active support of Pybrms. As such the project was taken away and taken to end state by a mixed group completed by a team of reseachers with a PyMC-labs Bambi (Abril-Pla et al. 2023) implementation allowing for ease to end users and the option for variety of modern inference algorithms gpu utitlities with use of Googles jax auto-diff library. 

What does this repo offer then? The following code is direct implementaion of RBA type models if raw pymc. This will allow for learning for end users how implement such methods directly and the freedom this can provide as well as. Additionally speed ups can be achived with direct implementation that is not possible when using generalised data analsysis softwares such as brms.

Note: The author is a massive fan of Bambi package. The resources provided by the core team made these speedups possible throught the open sourcing of their code. For that I am grateful.
