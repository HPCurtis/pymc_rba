# PyMC RBA
Direct PyMC implementation of AFNI's region Based analysis (RBA) analysis.

The following repo is inspired by a project that I was privy too at OHBM hackathon 2022 (which at the time  did not have the technical skills or confidence to assist that much with) that was inspired by the the AFNI group reasearcher Gang chen who implemented Bayesian multilevel modelling for region based analysis with the use brms BÃ¼rkner (2021) and the [RBA.R programme](https://github.com/afni/afni/blob/master/src/R_scripts/RBA.R) who initially wanted to implement the programme through pybrms [see](https://github.com/adamhaber/pybrms). Unforutnately there is no active support of pybrms. As such the project was taken away by a group of researchers and taken to end state using a PyMC-labs Bambi implementation (Abril-Pla et al. 2023). This allowed for an ease of use to the end users and the option for variety of modern inference algorithms with GPU utitlities with use of Googles jax auto-diff library.

Of important note. Through use of four Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs. they gwere able to achieve signifcant speed ups (Moia et al., 2024) the code for that work can be found at [Dr Christopher Nolan's Github](https://github.com/crnolan/pyrba)

What does this repo offer then? The following code is direct implementaion of RBA type models in raw pymc mdoel API code. This will allow for learning for end users how implement such methods directly and the freedom this can provide as well as the additional speed ups can be achieved with direct implementation that is not possible when using generalised data analsysis softwares such as brms/bambi.

The implementation here uses the new Rust implemetation of the No- U-Turn sampler [nuts-rs](https://github.com/pymc-devs/nuts-rs) that gives massive cpu speed ups compared to PyMC default sampler due to implementation chocies. 

Note: The author is a massive fan of Bambi package. The resources provided by the PyMC-lab/Bambi team made these speedups possible throught the open sourcing of their code. For that I am grateful.
